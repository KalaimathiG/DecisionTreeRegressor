# DecisionTreeRegressor
# Bike Sharing Prediction

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back at another position.

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. Aim of this project is the predict the
bike sharig behavior

# Resource
I have utilise the bike sharing data set available at https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset

I have utilised libraries Numpy,Pandas,matplolib,Seaborn,Scikit learn to solve the problem. 

# EDA

Below are some of the interesting plots, showing how certain feature affects the count.

# Model Building

I solved the problem using Decision tree regressor as well as Linear regressor. 

# Evaluation

I have utilised Rsquared,Mean absolute error,Mean Squared error,Root mean Squared methods for Evaluation process.
Based on my evaluation DecisionTreeRegressor suits this problem.
